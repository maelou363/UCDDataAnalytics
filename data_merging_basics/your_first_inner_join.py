# You have been tasked with figuring out what the most popular types of fuel used in Chicago taxis are. To complete the analysis, you need to merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables together on the vid column. You can then use the merged table along with the .value_counts() method to find the most common fuel_type.

# Since you'll be working with pandas throughout the course, the package will be preloaded for you as pd in each exercise in this course. Also the taxi_owners and taxi_veh DataFrames are loaded for you.



# Merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables setting a suffix
taxi_own_veh = taxi_owners.merge(taxi_veh, on='vid', suffixes=('_own','_veh'))

# Print the value_counts to find the most popular fuel_type
print(taxi_own_veh['fuel_type'].value_counts())
